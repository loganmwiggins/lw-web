## Logan Wiggins Personal Website

--------

#### Welcome

I began working on this website back in November of 2022 with no prior experience of web development languages or fundamentals. Throughtout this process, I was able to learn web development fundamentals and techniques — including how to conceptualize, design, write, test, debug, and maintain my own website. This project was a great first step into the world of software development. Now, I am continuing to enhance my development skills through university courses, job experiences, internship experiences, and more projects.
